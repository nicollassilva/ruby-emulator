# Private Ruby Emulator

This was an emulator of a private hotel called **Ruby Hotel**. Its base code is from the emulator made by Leon Hartley (Comet).

The updated resources contained in this emulator were developed and authored by developers **iNicollas** and **Djinn**. When the Ruby was closed, a guy wanted to make money by somehow getting the code and was selling the incomplete code to other people.

So I decided to make this repository public so that no one else would spend their money on a thief who claims to be a programmer and doesn't know how to do anything.

> Do not buy anything else related to Ruby Hotel, or you will lose your money, as well as your time trying to resolve package issues! You won't get support, and any systems you purchase will probably have to be configured by a good programmer. Don't believe in a miracle system because it doesn't exist, this emulator is good but there are better ones out there.
